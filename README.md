# INDIAN CROP PRODUCTION ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION:-

The Agriculture business domain, as a vital part of the overall supply chain, is expected 
to highly evolve in the upcoming years via the developments, which are taking place on 
the side of the Future Internet. This paper presents a novel Business-to-Business 
collaboration platform from the agri-food sector perspective, which aims to facilitate the 
collaboration of numerous stakeholders belonging to associated business domains, in an 
effective and flexible manner.
This dataset provides a huge amount of information on crop production in India ranging 
from several years. Based on the Information the ultimate goal would be to predict crop 
production and find important insights highlighting key indicators and metrics that 
influence the crop production.
Make views and dashboards first.

primary goal of this exploration workis to give a technique 
with the goal that it can perform illustrative examination 
on crop yield
